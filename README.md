# AWS
Begginers in AWS (CLI, boto3)

## About This Repository

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently a beginner in both **AWS cloud services** and **cybersecurity**. This repository contains a collection of scripts I've created as part of my learning journey.  

Most of the scripts here are written in **Python** and **Bash** and are designed to help automate tasks within AWS â€” for example, launching EC2 instances using **AWS CLI** or **Boto3 (the AWS SDK for Python)**.

At this stage, these are relatively simple scripts intended for personal use and practice. However, each script has been **tested** and should work as long as you provide the appropriate configuration values (such as your AMI ID, key pair name, or security group name).  

I'm sharing them here both to document my progress and to potentially help other beginners in cloud automation and security.

## Contents

- **Python (.py) scripts:**  
  Automating EC2 instance creation, security group management, password retrieval, etc.

- **Shell (.sh) scripts:**  
  AWS CLI commands for quickly launching instances and managing resources.

---

## Notes

- Before using any script, make sure you have:
  - Correctly configured your AWS CLI credentials (`aws configure`).
  - Updated the required parameters in the scripts (like `AMI_ID`, `KEY_NAME`, `SECURITY_GROUP_NAME`, etc.)
  - The necessary permissions in your AWS account to perform the actions.

- All scripts are **tested in a personal AWS account environment** using the **Free Tier** wherever possible.

## Future Plans

As I continue learning, I plan to expand this repository by adding:
- More advanced automation scripts.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions using **Terraform** and **AWS CloudFormation**.
- Security auditing scripts and tools for AWS environments.
- Documentation on how each script works and what it does.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

Here are a few ideas I might add to this README in the future:
- Example usage for each script.
- A small troubleshooting section for common errors.
- Screenshots or command line outputs showing the scripts in action.
- A learning resources section with links to AWS and cybersecurity materials I found helpful.

Thank you for visiting this repository!  
Feel free to use or adapt these scripts for your own AWS practice projects. ðŸš€
